Tinc is a meshing network which means everyone is connected to everyone else and no one node is a "server".
It circumvents NAT, uses ED25519 for auth, backwards compatible, works on all major oses including openwrt.
At the time of writing there are 2 versions of tinc 1.0.x and 1.1.x
1.1 is the pre release version and some feature are backported to the 1.0. I will be talking about the 1.1 version as I find this has the best tools.

Although it's a meshing network and no one node is a server it's easiest to get started when you have an external server that is connected directly to the net, it makes getting around NAT easier.

## Installing tinc 1.1
Some distros have it in their user repos or experimental versions, but you can also just compile, it's been made quite easy.

``` bash
sudo apt-get install -y make gcc libssl-dev zlib1g-dev liblzo2-dev libncurses5-dev libreadline6-dev # Build Dependencies
wget https://www.tinc-vpn.org/packages/tinc-1.1pre15.tar.gz
tar xf tinc-1.1pre15.tar.gz
cd tinc-1.1pre15
./configure --with-systemd --prefix=/usr --sysconfdir=/etc --localstatedir=/var --sbindir=/usr/sbin --with-systemdsystemunitdir=/usr/lib/systemd/system # Default flags for most distros
./make # Make bins
./make install # Install Tinc 1.1
```

## Creating your first node
First you will want to create a node, lets call it Alice.
``` bash
tinc -n mynet init alice # Generates node config under /etc/tinc/mynet
cd /etc/tinc/mynet
```

You should see:

| File             | Purpose                                                              |
| ---------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| ed25519_key.priv | Eliptic Curve private key                                            |
| rsa_key.priv     | RSA Private key, for use with 1.0 tinc nodes                         |
| hosts/           | Contains all the references to nodes                                 |
| tinc-up          | Is run when the tinc interface is brough up, set ip and routing here |
| tinc.conf        | Main config file for this node, who to connect to, binding etc       |


Next we want to tell tinc which `Subnet` Alice will be using.

``` bash
tinc -n mynet add Subnet 10.100.10.1/32 # Sets subnet entry for Alice host under hosts/
```

Tinc uses the `Subnet` entries to build the routing table.
You can decide how big you want each hosts `Subnet`, as long it's a valid CIDR tinc will accept it.
For the most part I set each host to use `/32` which means Tinc only sends traffic to that one ip, but you can bridge whole sites i.e.`/16` networks.

Next edit `tinc-up` and you will see:
``` bash
#!/bin/sh
echo 'Unconfigured tinc-up script, please edit '$0'!'

#ifconfig $INTERFACE <your vpn IP address> netmask <netmask of whole VPN>
```

Replace it with:
``` bash
#!/bin/sh
ip link set $INTERFACE up
ip addr replace 10.100.10.1/24 dev $INTERFACE
```
Keep in mind the `/24` here in respect to the host `Subnet` mask you set earlier. Usually I subtract 8 from that so that you get `10.100.10.0/24`

## Add bob node
Before inviting Bob we need to make sure the Address directive is set in the Alice host file.
``` bash
tinc -n mynet set Address `curl icanhazip.com` # Set external ip entry, this can also be a hostname i.e.example.com
```
This is so when the host file is exchanged with other nodes they can connect to the external address of Alice.
This only really makes sense where you have a server on the internet, or are lucky enough to have a static IP if your doing this from home.
If you have a dyndns to your home net, or a domain set up for your server you will want to use that when setting the address.

On Alice run `tinc -n mynet invite bob` this will output a string you can use on Bob to join.
Keep this string safe momentarily as you will need it again.

Under `/etc/tinc/mynet/invitations` you should see a random file name, edit this file and at the top you will see

``` ini
Name = Bob
NetName = mynet
ConnectTo = alice
#---------------------------------------------------------------#
```

Right below the `ConnectTo` add `Subnet = 10.100.10.2/32` and below that `Ifconfig = 10.100.10.2/24`.
This will configure Bob's host file and `tinc-up` script.

You should end up with
``` ini
Name = Bob
NetName = mynet
ConnectTo = alice
Subnet = 10.100.10.2/32
Ifconfig = 10.100.10.2/24
#---------------------------------------------------------------#
```

Make sure Alice is running, either `systemctl start tinc@mynet` or `tinc -n mynet start`
I prefer the systemctl so that I can add it to boot time.

On Bob run `tinc -n join <string>` where *<string>* is the string output from Alice when you invited Bob.
Answer yes to using the imported `tinc-up` config.

Now that Bob has joined the network that Alice is in the two sides should be able to ping each other using their tinc ip.
